	<h2>Why did you seek out Private Tutoring even though office hours are available?</h2><hr>
<div>
	<ul>
    <li>The CIS center </li>
    <li>Due to a disorder, I had trouble attending lecture. Michael was able to keep me up to date on my assignments while also teaching me the skills from class. Extra help lab hours were extremely crowded and unhelpful due to the number of students the teachers had to help.</li>
    <li>Because office hours are terrible and the tutoring is amazing </li>
    <li>Because office hourse  does not  go with my school schedule. and the private tutoring is much better , for scheduling and appointment  and understanding the material.     </li>
    <li>I wasn't getting as much help as I needed, and my GTF wasn't helpful in explaining the material whatsoever.
    in office hours I wasn't feeling that I could get the one-on-one time help I needed. Michael sits down with me and really talks everything out. He does every project with me and doesn't let me continue until I understand what I did. He is patient and really cares about the people he tutors. Honestly would be struggling a ton without him this term</li>
    <li>I needed tutoring because programming was like learned by to read Chinese. He was always kind, polite, and professional. </li>
    <li>There is no way I would have gotten as far as I have without Mike! </li>
    <li>Thanks for reaching out during lab and being easily accessible. I was really struggling. ~Linda</li>
